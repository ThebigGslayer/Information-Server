# Information-Server
I developed an Information Server using Python (Tkinter) and SQLite to securely store and manage usernames, passwords, and notes. It includes features like record editing, multiple deletions, and a select-all option for easier data handling. I also integrated basic Firewall and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) functions to simulate monitoring.
